# Christmas Hat Generator (xmas-hat-gen)

Generate a lovely Christmas Hat on your favorite anime characters.

I am new to Golang, React and Docker and this project was created for learning purpose. If you find some obvious
mistakes, I would appreciate it if you could create an issue or pull request. ðŸ˜‹

# Docker

Clone this repository, and run:

`docker compose up`

Wait till all services are up. You can access `http://localhost:8080/` to generate your Christmas Hat now!
